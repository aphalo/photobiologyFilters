Internal Transmittance data
Please note: there are no equal distances between wavelength sampling points beyond 1100 nm.

Dispersion formulas
For some glasses the coefficients of the Sellmeier or Hartmann dispersion formula are given
These formulas are accurate only for the specified limits
Please note, that the unit of wavelength is "um" for these formulas!
