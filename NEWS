photobiologyFilters 0.2.4
=========================

Added data for Petri dishes.

photobiologyFilters 0.2.3
=========================

Revised script used for creating filter data objects. To avoid problems with 
conversions to absorbance and taking into account that what can be really
measured is that transmittance is below the detection limit of the
instrument used, the minimum value of fractional transmittance has been
forced to be 1 E-5, with the meaning of < 1 E-5, consistently with the
earlier encoding used for Schott optical glass filters.

photobiologyFilters 0.2.2
=========================

Added data for Plexiglas 2458 GT (SUNTAN).

photobiologyFilters 0.2.1
=========================

Rebuilt with photobiology 0.5.7, which is now required.
The User Guide was updated to use simpler code as allowed by photobiologygg 0.2.5.

photobiologyFilters 0.2.0
=========================

Rebuilt with photobiology 0.5.1, now required, which needed minor edits to the User Guide.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.13
==========================

Rebuilt all filter.spct objects with photobiology 0.4.6
Vignettes updated.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.12
==========================

Added to the 'catalogue of filters' vignette plots for filters that were missing.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.11
==========================

Cleaned up the scripts I use for building the data objects. Decided so save storage space and to only include spectral transmittances expressed as fractions of one, now that the design of the code in the photobiology package is getting stable. Revised the 'catalogue of filters' vignette to solve some plotting problems, and to simplify the code used.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.10
==========================

Renamed all filter spectra objects from '.dt' to '.spct'.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.9
=========================

Added data for several plastic sheet types including several types of Plexiglas.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.8
=========================

Added data for many Schott optical filters.
Now data is in data.table format (compatible with data.frame), added class attributes preparing for future improvements.
Data is now in S3 objects of class "filter.spc" but no class methods are yet defined.
The names of the variables in the "filter.spc" objects has changed and now they contain the data both as percentages
and fractions. This makes use easier, but wastes some storage space. Now photobiology 0.3.0 or later is required.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.7
=========================

Function calc_filter_multipliers() was moved to package photobiology. However, this should be mostly invisible because the whole photobiology package is imported.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.6
=========================

Added data for some optical glass filters from Schott.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.5
=========================

Fixed a BAD bug in the rescaling code in calc_filter_multipliers that affected the returned values (percents vs. fractions).

photobiologyFilters 0.1.4
=========================

Added missing import directive.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.3
=========================

Small edits to vignettes.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.2
=========================

Fixed documentation.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.1
=========================

Added warning to documentation as the spectral transmittance for Rosco #00 is not that of the filters currently being sold.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.0
=========================

First version. Includes transmittance spectra for many of the filters we have measured during the last 20 years.
