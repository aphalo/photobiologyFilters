photobiologyFilters 0.1.8
=========================

Added data for many Schott optical filters.
Now data is in data.table format (compatible with data.frame), added class attributes preparing for future improvements.
Data is now in S3 objects of class "filter.spc" but no class methods are yet defined.
The names of the variables in the "filter.spc" objects has changed and now they contain the data both as percentages
and fractions. This makes use easier, but wastes some storage space. Now photobiology 0.3.0 or later is required.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.7
=========================

Function calc_filter_multipliers() was moved to package photobiology. However, this should be mostly invisible because the whole photobiology package is imported.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.6
=========================

Added data for some optical glass filters from Schott.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.5
=========================

Fixed a BAD bug in the rescaling code in calc_filter_multipliers that affected the returned values (percents vs. fractions).

photobiologyFilters 0.1.4
=========================

Added missing import directive.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.3
=========================

Small edits to vignettes.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.2
=========================

Fixed documentation.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.1
=========================

Added warning to documentation as the spectral transmittance for Rosco #00 is not that of the filters currently being sold.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.0
=========================

First version. Includes transmittance spectra for many of the filters we have measured during the last 20 years.
