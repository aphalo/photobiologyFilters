photobiologyFilters 0.1.7
=========================

Function calc_filter_multipliers() was moved to package photobiology. However, this should be mostly invisible because the whole photobiology package is imported.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.6
=========================

Added data for some optical glass filters from Schott.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.5
=========================

Fixed a BAD bug in the rescaling code in calc_filter_multipliers that affected the returned values (percents vs. fractions).

photobiologyFilters 0.1.4
=========================

Added missing import directive.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.3
=========================

Small edits to vignettes.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.2
=========================

Fixed documentation.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.1
=========================

Added warning to documentation as the spectral transmittance for Rosco #00 is not that of the filters currently being sold.

photobiologyFilters 0.1.0
=========================

First version. Includes transmittance spectra for many of the filters we have measured during the last 20 years.
