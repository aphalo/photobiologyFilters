Package photobiologyFilters is a collection of spectral transmittance data for various filters that we use or have used in our lab. It also includes a function for obtaining interpolated data for the included datasets (by name) or from arbitrary (user) filter transmittance data.

This R package is a new extension to a rewrite with a new user interface of the package UVcalc that started as companion to a handbook of methods in plant UV photobiology writen within the COST Action FA0906 UV4growth. The programing was done by P. J. Aphalo, but the information used was collected, discussed and evaluated in many cases by other contributors to the handbook.
