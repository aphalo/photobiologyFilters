#' @title Filter spectra data forcellulose di-acetate film
#' 
#' @description Datasets containing the wavelengths at a 1 nm interval and 
#' tabulated values spectral transmittance for Courttaulds di-acetate films.
#' 
#' 1) Films (0.115 mm thick) stretched 25 cm below lamps Q-Panel UVB313 and 
#' exposed to UV radiaition from different lengths of time per day. All films
#' were installed and sampled at the same time. The digits give the number of
#' minutes per day that the lamps were on.
#' 
#' 2) New films of different thicknesses. 
#' 
#' @details The variables are as follows:
#' 
#' \itemize{ 
#'   \item w.length (nm) 
#'   \item Tfr (fraction) 
#' }

#' @note Instrument used: Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer without
#' an integrating sphere.
